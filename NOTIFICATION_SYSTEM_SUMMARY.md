# Notification System Implementation Summary

## Task 14: 기본 알림 시스템 구현 (Grafana/Alertmanager 제거)

This document summarizes the implementation of the unified Slack notification system for the Reddit Ghost Publisher MVP.

## 14.1 Slack 알림 시스템 구현 ✅

### Components Implemented

#### 1. Core Notification System (`app/monitoring/notifications.py`)
- **SlackNotifier**: Unified Slack notification class with standardized templates
- **AlertManager**: Manages alert conditions and triggers notifications
- **AlertSeverity**: Enum for alert severity levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- **AlertService**: Enum for service types (Collector, NLP Pipeline, Publisher, System, etc.)

#### 2. Budget Tracking System (`app/monitoring/budget_tracker.py`)
- **BudgetTracker**: Tracks API usage and triggers alerts at threshold levels
- Reddit API daily usage monitoring (calls made vs. daily limit)
- OpenAI token daily usage monitoring (tokens used vs. daily limit)
- Automatic alert triggering at 80% usage threshold
- Budget exhaustion detection (100% usage)

#### 3. Alert Service Integration (`app/monitoring/alert_service.py`)
- **AlertService**: Centralized alert service for system monitoring
- Integrates failure rate, queue backlog, and budget monitoring
- Comprehensive system status reporting
- Automated alert checking with configurable thresholds

#### 4. Celery Tasks (`app/monitoring/tasks.py`)
- Periodic health checks (every 5 minutes)
- Daily report generation and sending
- Individual alert check tasks (failure rate, queue backlog, budget)
- Task scheduling integration with Celery Beat

#### 5. API Endpoints (`app/api/routes/monitoring.py`)
- `/api/v1/monitoring/status` - Get comprehensive system status
- `/api/v1/monitoring/budget` - Get API budget usage summary
- `/api/v1/monitoring/alerts/check` - Manually trigger all monitoring checks
- `/api/v1/monitoring/alerts/failure-rate` - Check failure rate alerts
- `/api/v1/monitoring/alerts/queue-backlog` - Check queue backlog alerts
- `/api/v1/monitoring/alerts/budget` - Check API budget alerts
- `/api/v1/monitoring/alerts/custom` - Send custom alerts
- `/api/v1/monitoring/config` - Get monitoring configuration
- `/api/v1/monitoring/health` - Health check for monitoring system

### Alert Types Implemented

1. **Failure Rate Alert** (Requirements 7.3)
   - Triggers when failure rate > 5% over 5-minute sliding window
   - Severity: HIGH
   - Includes current rate, threshold, and time window

2. **Queue Backlog Alert** (Requirements 7.3)
   - Triggers when total pending tasks > 500
   - Severity: MEDIUM
   - Includes queue breakdown and manual scaling guidance

3. **API Budget Alerts** (Requirements 7.3, 7.4)
   - Reddit API: Triggers at 80% of daily call limit
   - OpenAI API: Triggers at 80% of daily token limit
   - Severity: MEDIUM (80%) or HIGH (100%)
   - Includes usage percentage and remaining quota

### Standardized Alert Template

All alerts follow a unified Slack template with:
- Severity level with appropriate emoji and color
- Service identification
- Clear message description
- Relevant metrics
- Timestamp and time window information
- Consistent formatting and structure

### Components Implemented

#### 1. Daily Report Generator (`app/monitoring/daily_report.py`)
- **DailyReportGenerator**: Comprehensive daily report generation
- Aggregates metrics from multiple database tables
- Calculates cost analysis and performance metrics
- Determines overall system status
- Sends formatted reports to Slack

#### 2. Report Metrics Collected

**Collection Metrics:**
- Posts collected from Reddit
- Collection failures and success rate
- Unique subreddits processed

**Processing Metrics:**
- Posts processed with AI
- Processing failures and success rate
- Average processing time

**Publishing Metrics:**
- Posts published to Ghost
- Publishing failures and success rate
- Posts with Ghost URLs

**Token Usage Metrics:**
- Total tokens used by model (GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4o)
- API calls made
- Cost breakdown by model
- Average tokens per call

**Error Metrics:**
- Total failures by service
- Most common error types
- Error classification and trends

**Performance Metrics:**
- Average processing times by service
- Min/max processing times
- Overall system performance

#### 3. Cost Analysis

**Comprehensive Cost Tracking:**
- Total daily cost in USD
- Cost per post processed
- Estimated monthly cost projection
- Cost per 1K tokens efficiency metric
- Model-specific cost breakdown

#### 4. Status Determination

**Overall Status Levels:**
- **Excellent**: >95% success rates, 0 failures
- **Good**: >90% success rates, <5 failures
- **Fair**: >80% success rates, <10 failures
- **Poor**: Lower success rates or high failure count

#### 5. Slack Report Format

**Daily Report Includes:**
- Overall status with appropriate emoji and color
- Success rate percentage
- Posts collected, processed, and published
- Token usage and total cost
- Failure count and average processing time
- Cost breakdown by model (if significant)
- Top error summary (if failures occurred)

### API Integration

#### New Endpoints Added:
- `GET /api/v1/monitoring/reports/daily` - Get daily report data
- `POST /api/v1/monitoring/reports/daily` - Trigger daily report sending

#### Celery Integration:
- Daily report task scheduled for 6 AM UTC
- Manual trigger capability via API
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Required:
```bash
# Slack Notifications
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/...

# Alert Thresholds
QUEUE_ALERT_THRESHOLD=500
FAILURE_RATE_THRESHOLD=0.05  # 5%

# Budget Limits
REDDIT_DAILY_CALLS_LIMIT=5000
OPENAI_DAILY_TOKENS_LIMIT=100000
```

### Celery Beat Schedule:
```python
# Health checks every 5 minutes
"run-health-checks": {
    "task": "app.monitoring.tasks.run_health_checks",
    "schedule": crontab(minute="*/5")
}

# Daily report at 6 AM UTC
"send-daily-report": {
    "task": "app.monitoring.tasks.send_daily_report", 
    "schedule": crontab(hour=6, minute=0)
}
```

## Testing

### Test Coverage:
- **SlackNotifier**: Alert sending, daily reports, severity levels
- **BudgetTracker**: Usage calculation, alert thresholds, exhaustion detection
- **DailyReportGenerator**: Report structure, cost analysis, status determination
- **AlertManager**: Failure rate alerts, queue backlog alerts

### Test Results:
- 14 tests implemented
- All tests passing
- Comprehensive mocking of external dependencies
- Validation of alert templates and report formats

## Requirements Compliance

### ✅ Requirements 7.3 (Alert Thresholds):
- Failure rate > 5% alerts implemented
- Queue backlog > 500 alerts implemented
- Unified Slack alert templates with severity, service, metrics

### ✅ Requirements 7.4 (Daily Reports):

- Collection/processing/publishing metrics aggregation
- Cost estimation and analysis
- Slack daily report delivery

## Integration Points

### Database Integration:
- ProcessingLog table for metrics aggregation
- TokenUsage table for cost tracking
- Post table for publishing metrics

### Redis Integration:
- Queue length monitoring
- Real-time queue status

### External Services:
- Slack webhook integration
- Standardized error handling
- Retry logic and fallbacks

## Monitoring Dashboard

The system provides comprehensive monitoring through:
1. Real-time API endpoints for status checking
2. Automated periodic health checks
3. Proactive alerting at configurable thresholds
4. Daily comprehensive reporting
5. Manual trigger capabilities for all monitoring functions

This implementation provides a robust, scalable notification system that meets all MVP requirements while maintaining simplicity and operational efficiency.
